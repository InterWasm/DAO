## Summary

The CosmWasm IDE for Visual Studio Code has been actively developed by Oraichain. This proposal requests funds for the Oraichain team to maintain the project and build a compatible version for Intellij.

## Motivation

Because many developers use Intellij, there is a need for the CosmWasm IDE to run on it as well. This proposal is to fund the developers contributing to the project and push marketing.

## Specification

At the moment, the CosmWasm developers can download and use the latest version on [Gitpod](https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-gitpod) & [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oraichain.cosmwasm). Developers can interact with an existing smart contract or deploy a new one. The IDE supports multi CosmWasm version and integrates Keplr on browser. If it is used locally using the VS Code application, we can copy paste the test mnemonics to interact with the contracts.

We expect the Intellij version to have the same functionalities as those of VS Code. If the community requests more features, we are happy to add & maintain them.

## Team(Optional)

[Oraichain team](https://orai.io).
