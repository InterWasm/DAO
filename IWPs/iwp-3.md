## Summary

What is this proposal about?

DAO DAO is a DAO building DAO tooling for the Cosmos ecosystem.

This is proposal is to fund some of the developers contributing to DAO DAO core development.

## Motivation

Why do you want to make this happen?

If you've ever tried to be part of a Cosmos multisig, the UX is exceptionally bad. Multisig + DAO tooling will greatly accelerate innovation in the Cosmos ecosystem.

InterWasm DAO itself will use this tooling.

## Specification

How will you make it?

First version is already built: https://daodao.zone

We are aiming to add more features and finalize the v1.0.0 of the smart contracts.

## Team

- [Gavin](https://github.com/gavindoughtie) is a long-time software engineer specializing in code that humans interact with. He wrote the database and much of the utility UI for the Picasa photo management application, animation tools at DreamWorks, web and native mobile applications at Google and more. He's interested in platforms that enable permissionless innovation: the web, open source and now blockchain. He's particularly excited by tools that enable positive and incentivized collective action without generating a power hierarchy in their wake.
- [Eliot](https://github.com/ebaker) is excited to contribute and build web3 applications with over 8 years of professional web development experience.
- [Zeke](https://github.com/ezekiiel) does internet research at UC Berkeley and loves open source.
