# Summary

This proposal requests funds for bootstrapping recently found deus labs collective. Furthermore, the funds will be used for the DevRel efforts that are covered in this proposal.

We want this proposal to be an example for the other teams in the space. To show that DevRel itself is a project.

## Who we are and our motivation

Our team member [@orkunkl](https://github.com/orkunkl) has been a prominent contributor to the CosmWasm ecosystem, committed to the improvement of the developer experience. Thus he set this collective to scale CosmWasm ecosystem to its next level. As part of InterWasm, we provide support systems, documentation, workshops, and events; continuing our work and ensuring a healthy growth for the broader ecosystem.

- Clearing out and managing documentation
- Developed a simple UI for communicating with cw1-subkey contracts: https://subkeys.deuslabs.fi/ 
- Setting up and managing validators on Juno and Stargaze
- Mentoring projects that use CosmWasm and networking for more

## Roadmap
