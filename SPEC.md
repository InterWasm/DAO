## Executive Summary

InterWasm DAO is an organisation that aims to ensure the success of the CosmWasm Ecosystem.

InterWasm DAO will:
- Own codebases
- Fund community good projects
- Boost community growth
- Organize events

Later it will become an on-chain DAO
Initial fund $200K USD in ATOMs collected under multisig wallet
Fund distribution will be approved by multisig wallet owners

## What Is InterWasm DAO?

CosmWasm was born at Hackatom Berlin 2019 by the hands of several code magicians. Initially it was just testing a possibility...

Now, CosmWasm spans many blockchains, communities, and continents. Today, the technology powers and secures trillions of dollars. Many more eyes are looking into CosmWasm, either as smart contract devs, or blockchains that desire Cosmos and CosmWasm capabilities.

CosmWasm is cross chain first framework. Ecosystem development is Inherently decentralized.

**InterWasm DAO** is the organisation behind CosmWasm and cw tooling.

It will initially be run by the existing chains and their Foundations, and later be owned by an open community of users and contributors.

## What are InterWasm DAO's roles?

InterWasm DAO will own:

- CosmWasm codebase ownership will be delegated to the community gradually
    - Initially CosmWasm docs repo maintainership will be owned by foundations.
    - Contracts written by the community will be collected under the `cosmwasm-contracts` repo.
    - High quality smart contracts should be collected under `cosmwasm-plus`. Quality of the code will be ensured by the repo maintainers.
- Fund distribution among the community-goods projects.
- Organising cross chain events.
- Collection of data regarding Developer Relations (developer number, community size etc...) and sharing it with the community.

## Funding

InterWasm DAO should distribute funds effectively among community-good projects.

Initially, we will collect $200K's worth of ATOM, and start funding projects right away.

## Decision Making

Initially decision making will happen by communication in open/closed channels such as foundation chats.

Each foundation will provide an address which will be used for forming a %66 percent approval multisig wallet.

Agreeing foundations will send the required funds to the project funding addresses.

InterWasm DAO must decentralize more to open up to the community. This will be done by making the organisation a real on-chain DAO smart contract.

At Confio, we propose hosting the InterWasm DAO on a neutral zone: **Juno network**.

The Juno Network will be shipping a Gaia Hub IBC bridge on its launch.

Details and implementation of the DAO smart contract will be discussed at a later time.

## Initial Board of Members
These are the project/companies that are currently most active in the CosmWasm community.
(More members can be added later)

- Confio
- Terraform Labs
- Enigma
- Juno community representatives

## Proposals

Proposals are a structured and organised way for decentralized decision making.

Projects can ask for funds using proposals.

Changes to common CosmWasm code should be done through proposals.

Initially proposals will be collected under the CosmWasm github organisation, under the InterWasm repo.

See more: [InterWasm Proposals](#interwasm-proposalsiwps)

## Workgroups

For the internal and external projects, members of the InterWasm DAO can form workgroups and work on specific issues or topics.

## First 6 months

Here are few project ideas that could be funded:
- **Code and Smart Contract Explorer**
- **CosmWasm AssemblyScript Integration**
- **Documentation and Tutorials**
- **1.0-rc1 Audit**
- **CosmWasm IDE by OraiChain**
- **cw-alarm-clock**

Misc:
- **Maintain InterWasm Events Calendar**

# InterWasm Proposals(IWPs)

InterWasm Proposals formalizes DAO decision making. Initially used for collecting grant requests for projects.

Use [InterWasm Proposal Template iwp-0](IWPs/iwp-0.md) as basis for your proposal.

## Proposal Types

**Grant** - Proposal asking for grants to develop a project or tooling.

## Proposal Status

**Draft** - Initial ideation of a proposal.

**Review** - InterWasm Members marks an IWP as ready for and requesting Peer Review.

**Funded** - Special status for grant type proposals. Indicates the project is funded and waiting for development.

**Final** - Proposal finalized. All is delivered.
