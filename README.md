# InterWasm DAO

InterWasm DAO is an organisation that aims to ensure the success of the CosmWasm Ecosystem.

InterWasm DAO will:

- Own codebases
- Fund community good projects
- Boost community growth
- Organize events

## Initial Board of Members

These are the project/companies that are currently most active in the CosmWasm community.

- Confio
- Terraform Labs
- Enigma
- Juno community representatives

More members can and will be added later.

Initially, decision making will happen by communication in open/closed channels such as foundation chats. Each foundation will provide an address which will be used for forming a %66 percent approval multisig wallet.

InterWasm DAO is currently operating from a [temporary multisig on DAO DAO beta](). Once DAO DAO smart contracts have been audited, agreeing foundations will send the required funds to the project funding addresses.
